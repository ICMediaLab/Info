Snake Competition

We want to see you guys make the best Snake game you can!

The reason is simple. Most people do not have a lot of experience and snake is a great place to start. Its simple to make however also very simple to extend meaning you can simply use it as an opportunity to learn the basics or one to flex your programming muscles!

The deadline for the game will be the last week of term and in our last meeting of term we will judge each game and the group or individual with the best game will get a prize!

Use this github account to set up your own repo, call your repo something like: CIDSnake. Groups can be as large or as small as you want and we will take your experience and group size into account when judging the games. 

The temptation to copy each others code will probably be pretty great but try to play fair. Nonetheless this is an opportunity to learn from each other so feel free to ask one another for help and share code if you want to!
