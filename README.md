IC Media Lab - Introduction to the group and Getting started with Games Programming

Note this document is a work in progress, we will continue to improve and update it over time.

The IC Media Lab is a place where students interested in games development can come together to learn from each other and use the resources available to develop games.

We operate with a flat hierarchy where every member is just as important as the rest and people can move around freely between projects and help each other on whatever they are currently working on. The Society's chair acts as a contact point between the students and the academics and overseas the projects currently being worked on. Think Valve but at University level.

Remember, in real games development houses it is essential that people know how to communicate well, so for us to function well as a group it is important that you talk to each other. We all have a common goal and by helping one another we can learn and achieve a lot more. Although Notch may have done it on his own, most big budget games have teams of over 50 people.

As we are likely to all be at varying programming skill levels this document will try to help point the members of the IC Media Lab in the direction of resources and tutorials to help give them a decent grounding and understanding of game programming concepts and the common languages used.

For people who already have a solid grounding in games programming we have compiled suggestions from members as to what other resource and sites may be useful.

The ICMediaLab github account is a shared account between all members. Whenever you feel you want to create a new project simply set up a repo with your name or project name.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on what you are interested and your skill level we can suggest the following options for tutorials. Its probably best not to start with C/C++, although they are the industry standard its very hard to get thrown in the deep end and start with them. Java and C# are probably better places to get started although its your choice.

Note in time we will elaborate on this section giving clear and concise advice on how to get started and what tutorials are best to look at. For now here is a list of tutorials grouped under categories you may be interested in.
